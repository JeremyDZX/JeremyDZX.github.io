collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'This paper presents pPIRW, an efficient and accurate pre-calculation stochastic solver for steady-state thermal simulation of ICs with mixed boundary conditions, especially Robin boundary conditions. Interestingly, we reveal and numerically validate that the pPIRW essentially calculates a partial inverse of the large-scale thermal resistance matrix G in the CTM using stochastic methods. The pPIRW can be integrated within a thermal management strategy as a temperature predictor for IC hot-spots.'
